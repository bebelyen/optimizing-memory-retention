Optimizing-Memory-Retention: Evaluating Cognitive Strategies in Humans
Experimental design study on what  most effective form of memory retention in humans. 
Investigated impact of caffeine consumption and physical exercise using randomized block factorial experiment with college students. 

Approach:
Collaborated with my team of UCLA students as a part of our experimental design course. 
Used simulated island experiment with college students and explored whether these factors measurably influence cognitive performance in short-term recall tasks.
Designed randomized block design with 3x3 factorial strucutre. 
Blcoked weight and gender above and below the median. 
Response variable was difference in pre/post treatment memory test scores. 
Each participant randomly assigned to one caffeine treatment and one exercise treatment.
15-minute delay was built in post-caffeine intake to allow for physiological absorption before the memory test.

Analysis: 
Performed in R using ANOVA to evaluate main and interactive effects. 
Tukey's HSD: post-hoc pairwise comparisons 
Assumption Checks: normality, linearity, and homoscedasticity confimred via residual plots. 

Findings:
Among caffeine treatments, energy drinks produced the largest mean improvement in memory test scores.
No exercise type (jogging, stretching, or walking) had a significant independent effect.
Diagnostic plots confirmed model validity and met regression assumptions.
These results align with prior literature showing caffeine’s positive role in memory enhancement (Sherman et al., 2016) and the limited cognitive effect of brief exercise interventions (Zabriskie & Heath, 2019)
